###Range Sum Query - Immutable
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/</br>
Given an integer _array nums_, find the sum of the elements between indices _i_ and _j_ (_i_ â‰¤ _j_), inclusive.

####Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1</br>
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1</br>
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3</br>

####Note:
1. You may assume that the array does not change.
2. There are many calls to sumRange function.
