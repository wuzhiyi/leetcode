###Basic Calculator II
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/</br>
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only __non-negative__ integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:

	"3+2*2" = 7
	" 3/2 " = 1
	" 3+5 / 2 " = 5

Note: Do not use the `eval` built-in library function.
